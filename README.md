# Smart Oxygen Supply System - GUI Mini Project

This project simulates a **Smart Oxygen Supply System** to assist individuals trapped inside a vehicle by detecting their presence and air quality, and triggering an emergency alert with oxygen ventilation.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Detects presence of occupants
- Monitors air quality status
- Triggers emergency alert if both conditions are critical
- Activates simulated oxygen supply and ventilation
- Plays alert sound using `oxygen_alert.wav.wav'
- Simple Tkinter-based GUI for demonstration

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Pygame (for audio playback)

## üìÇ Folder Structure

SmartOxygenProject/
  
    *smart_oxygen.py
    *oxygen_alert.wav.wav

> Make sure `oxygen_alert.wav` is in the same directory as your Python script.
